## Shopify Order Data Extraction through API Python
This notebook was created to make an API request to Shopify API and get resulting json data into a Data Frame.

I created a Python program that queries order information using the Shopify API. After the query, the web service returns a result in JSON format, which Python reads through a loop and converts into a DataFrame.
